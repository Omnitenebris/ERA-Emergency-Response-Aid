-----------------------

ICE lacks a simple interface and can be very confusing for those in distress, lacking quick functionality.

First Aid is very basic, providing only a core number of diseases (a simple database).

Ours will combine ease of use with a large database, easy interface, a panic button that informs all local emergency services and your social media profile. Also allowing for bookmarking features, allowing for offline access. As well as a map integration showing local shelters and emergency responders.

Integrating uber

------------------------


It is better for "disabled" people and those in distress, as we will allow for a faster response type instead of going through a bunch of tabs and searching for a solution to the issue at hand.

For example, and old professor dropped his glasses in lecture and is currently on the floor writhing around with a frothing mouth. His students are panicing, so if they pull up their ICE/FA app, they'll go through and wonder what's going on with him. Which category does he fall under? Ours will immediately contact local support services, and then bring up best responders, as well as a search button which they all lack.

-------------------

Possibly due to the fact that it wasn't what their app was designed to do. The feature was not a planned one, or they did not have enough time to implement it.
