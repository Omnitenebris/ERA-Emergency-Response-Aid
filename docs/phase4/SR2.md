    Division of post-sprint 3: Three members work on the polishing of the app while two work on the presesntation

    Front end Login and Registration Integration with backend database - Aun
    Complete navigation bar and user interface - Andrew
    Interactive body image. - Dellis

Bad Practices:

    Some people were unable to work on their part due to dependancies on the other.
    Using different libraries and dependances caused code to only work locally.
    
Good Practices:

    Everyone was able to complete their work when divided and independant.
    Integrating back end into front end using java and xml files was well executed by Aun.
