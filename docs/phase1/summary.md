Part 1: The Project Objective-
An emergency response aid, aimed to help people in distress. Similar to a 911 button without calling the police, it can identify any issues and give a proper response. With an easy to use interface and for allowing quick accessibility, for any and all age groups. 

Part 2: The Key Personas-
Old people: old people usually come with a bundle of "disabilities", this allows for a quick way to respond to any emergency.

Adventurers/Outdoorsmen: when going out hiking or the like, many different scenarios can occuur, in which having a first aid response would be nice- no time to wait for 911

Caretaker/Watcher: responsible for taking care of people en masse, or any unqualified person can provide first-aid assistance

Part 3: The Key Scenarios-
You're in a plane- there are snakes in the plane. You least favorite grandfather gets bitten, in the ass, and you don't want to suck the poison out of him. So you look at ERA- created by team 7, sponsored by G2A- for an alternative solution.

Person having a stroke- with the sun shining bright, the glasses reflecting a double rainbow, your favorite grandfather slows down and the right side of his face starts to droop. You know it's a symptom but of what? You pull up your handy ERA- created by team 7, sponsored by AMD- and realize he's having a stroke. Then, you can begin to adminster the proper first aid treatment.

Hiking accident- your grandmother has had enough of your least favorite grandfather, so she pushes him down a cliff onto a group of stampeding bisons. Then, you inherit the kingdom but your grandmother wanted it for herself all along. The app doesn't help.

Part 4: The Key Principles-
Help the "disabled", help the non-"disabled", help everyone. The app is meant to be simple, easy to use/understand, allowing for ease of access by any and all for any and all situations.

Monetize certain features.
