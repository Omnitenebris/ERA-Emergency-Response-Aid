### What is your most significant individual contribution?
 
Dellis: My most significant individual contribution was the panic button. Since it is one of the main features of this project.

Abdulla: The user interface, along with the navigation drawer as a package was the most significant. Allowing them to work with everyone else's code specifically.
 

 
 
 

### Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.

 Dellis: I learned that there are multiple types of layouts we can use for Android Studio.

Abdulla: It seemed as though Android Studio was designed to make things easy, but that in turn made it more difficult to implement more complex structures, which sets things in stone after they have been created.
 

 
 
 

### What is your main strength(s) as a team member?

Dellis: My main strength as a team member is that I'm flexible and learn things fast.
 
Abdulla: My main strength was debugging and patching issues, mostly caused by myself. There was more time spent fixing than introducing features.


 
 


### What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

 Dellis: My main weakness as a team member is my lack of experience of Android Studio, which is the main program we used for this project,
         and overall lack of knowledge about mobile applications. I think I can improve this by self-learning on the internet.
 
 Abdulla: My main weakness was not being proactive in the development stages, where I spent time waiting for everyone else instead of introducing skeleton structures to be implemented in. Next time, in this development environment, I'll build foundations before all the furniture was put in place.
