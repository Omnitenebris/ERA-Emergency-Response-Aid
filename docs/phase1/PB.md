• State your team’s numerical series you do intend to use to estimate user stories (as you did in week 7
tutorial)

• Identify the most important user stories.

• How many user stories? We are not sure. Enough to give us (and you) a good sense of the scope of
the project.

• As a guideline: a user story (usually) corresponds to a feature in your project.

• Any number between 3 and 20 might be appropriate.

• Each user story must obey the format stated in the lecture and it must also contain the criteria of
satisfaction.

• Each user story should include a priority and a point estimate (using the numerical scale stated above).

• Point estimate is a qualitative estimate, made by the team members. You will need to use planning
poker as in tutorial during week 7.

• By now you should have received our invitations to the Pivotal Tracker. Please accept your invitation
and record the stories on the tracker.

• The recorded stories on the tracker must match the stories on your PB.md.

• In case your team prefers to use a different tracking tool, please do invite your instructor and your
TAs (emails available on syllabus). We need to chekc your progress throughout the project.
