### What is your most significant individual contribution?
 
Dellis: My most significant individual contribution was the panic button. Since it is one of the main features of this project.

Abdulla: The user interface, along with the navigation drawer as a package was the most significant. Allowing them to work with everyone else's code specifically.

Spasimir: My most significant contribution was writing the code to connect us to apimedic (the medical api). This allowed us to get symptoms, diagnosis and treatments about diseases.

Muhammad: My most significant contribution was setting up the MySQL database hosted on 000webhost and creating PHP scripts to allow for get requests to be made from the app to to the database for registration and login validation.
 
 
### Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.

 Dellis: I learned that there are multiple types of layouts we can use for Android Studio.

Abdulla: It seemed as though Android Studio was designed to make things easy, but that in turn made it more difficult to implement more complex structures, which sets things in stone after they have been created.

Spasimir: I learned how to work with Android studio better than ever before. I also learned how to use its volley library to connect to an api and make get and post requests.
 
Muhammad: I learned about how compartmentalized android development is, i.e java classes need to be connected to the views (xml files) and the view hold components such as strings, dimensions, colors etc that are held in seperate resource files (also xml). 
 
 

### What is your main strength(s) as a team member?

Dellis: My main strength as a team member is that I'm flexible and learn things fast.
 
Abdulla: My main strength was debugging and patching issues, mostly caused by myself. There was more time spent fixing than introducing features.

Spasimir: My main strength is that I get my tasks done efficiently. 

Muhammad: My main strength is the ability to manage time effectively, I was able to prioritize tasks that were absolute must for the purpose to delivering a working demo in a small time period provide for the project. 
 
 

### What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

 Dellis: My main weakness as a team member is my lack of experience of Android Studio, which is the main program we used for this project,
         and overall lack of knowledge about mobile applications. I think I can improve this by self-learning on the internet.
 
 Abdulla: My main weakness was not being proactive in the development stages, where I spent time waiting for everyone else instead of introducing skeleton structures to be implemented in. Next time, in this development environment, I'll build foundations before all the furniture was put in place.
 
 Spasimir: My main weakness is that I didn't do enough research on libraries that are compatible with the newest version of android. Because of this I had to go back and redo a lot of work with new libraries that i didn't know. I will definitely improve so that this does not happen again.
 
 Muhammad: My main weekness is my communication skill, I need to do a better job at communicating my ideas and more importantly my thought process to my team members to support my design and logic decisions when programming or finding solution to problems.
