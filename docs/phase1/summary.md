Part 1: The Project Objective-
An emergency response aid, aimed to help people in distress. Similar to a 911 button without calling the police, it can identify any issues and give a proper response. With an easy to use interface and for allowing quick accessibility, for any and all age groups. 

Part 2: The Key Personas-
Elderly people: Elderly people usually come with a bundle of "disabilities", this allows for a quick way to respond to any emergency and/or alert any nearby services.

Adventurers/Outdoorsmen: when going out hiking or the like, many different scenarios can occuur, in which having a first aid response would be nice- no time to wait for 911

Caretaker/Watcher: responsible for taking care of people en masse, or any unqualified person can provide first-aid assistance

Part 3: The Key Scenarios-
You're in a rainforest - there are snakes in the rainforest. Your friend gets bitten, and you don't know what to do. So you look at ERA for a solution. If by any chance you cannot follow the solution, with the press of a button you can notify nearby medical services of your emergency and the app will send them your location.

Person having a stroke - you are playing with your favorite grandfather in the park when all of a sudden he slows down and the right side of his face starts to droop. You know it's a symptom but of what? You pull up your handy ERA and realize he's having a stroke. Then, you can begin to adminster the proper first aid treatment.

Hiking accident - prior to going hiking you find common accidents while hiking and you save them for offline use. During hiking you suffer a bad fall and you cannot move your leg. Thankfully you saved the common accidents for offline use. You pull up ERA and check what to do in this situation and you live to tell the tale

Part 4: The Key Principles-
Help the "disabled", help the non-"disabled", help everyone. The app is meant to be simple, easy to use/understand, allowing for ease of access by any and all for any and all situations.

Monetize certain features.
