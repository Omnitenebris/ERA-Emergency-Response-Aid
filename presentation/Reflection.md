### Tools, Techniques, Conventions, that worked

Android studio was great to work with in terms of ease of use, allowing lots of autocomplete and suggested features to be introduced seamlessly. Due to our lack of design experience, we used copyright free icons or crafted our own using simple software such as Paint.NET. The method of development we chose (agile) was more due to the way the professor wanted to track our app development (through the use of pivotal tracker, sprints, scrum meetings), but it worked well since we're all familiar with it and the steps are rather simple. Github was also nice to use for our version control, especially due to the nature of Android development, we had lots of branches to allow everyone to work their code without breaking another's.

### Tools, Techniques, Conventions, that failed

Initially, we started our application using Activies, which was fine until we decided to implement an application bar, menu, and navigation drawer. The three required the use of fragments, which is by allowing everyone to be integrated into another instead of starting new funtions. It failed though, due to us having already writted all our code into activies. The process of attempting to change to fragments in turn broke existing code (specifically the self diagnosis feature), which meant we had to instead write an ugly hack that simply set the application bar in stone instead of allowing it to flow with the application.

### Design & Process for the future

We do plan on continuing development (at least those still interested), but not as a priority. As such, our members will simply take some time every once in a while and introduce new features or brush up on old ones when time permits. We won't be following any development methods, instead everyone choosing their own personal style. Eventually, when it was brushed up enough and polished, we hope to push it to the Google Play Store, perhaps add a monetization feature to pay for Aun's brilliant backend.
